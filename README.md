## Introduction

This notebook is a companion to [] which is posted at [arxiv:](https://arxiv.org/abs/). It demonstrates how to read and use our posterior proability density files from the parameter estimation and shows how in principle to reconstruct Figure 3 in the paper from the raw data.

We encourage use of these data in derivative works.
